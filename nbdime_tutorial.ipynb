        "As you work on your team project with Jupyter Notebooks in a shared Git repository, you'll quickly encounter a major challenge: **Jupyter Notebooks are JSON files under the hood**.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you use standard `git diff`, Git compares the raw JSON structure of the notebook. This makes it nearly impossible to:\n",
        "- Read what actually changed in your code or markdown\n",
        "- Understand who modified which cell\n",
        "- Resolve conflicts manually without breaking the notebook structure\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's what a typical conflict looks like in raw JSON:\n",

        "- Show you clean, readable diffs of what actually changed in cells\n",
